# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project involves analyzing a comprehensive dataset on COVID-19 deaths and related statistics to uncover insights and patterns across different countries and regions. It aims to provide meaningful visualizations and statistical insights to better understand the global impact of the pandemic.

## Dataset
- **Name:** COVID-19 Dataset
- **Entries:** 5,770
- **Columns:** 17
- **Attributes:**
  - Country, Region, Population
  - Total deaths, COVID-19 deaths, Expected deaths, Excess deaths
  - Other related statistics

## Objectives
1. Explore and clean the dataset to ensure data consistency and accuracy.
2. Perform descriptive and exploratory data analysis to derive meaningful insights.
3. Visualize key findings using data visualization libraries.

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries Used:** 
  - Data Manipulation: `numpy`, `pandas`
  - Visualization: `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`
  - Other Tools: `openpyxl`, `streamlit`

## Key Insights
- Examined the relationship between population and COVID-19 deaths across countries.
- Identified regions with the highest excess deaths and compared them with expected death statistics.
- Explored trends in total deaths and COVID-19 deaths over time.

## Visualizations
- Comparative bar charts for COVID-19 deaths across regions.
- Line plots for trends in deaths over time.
- Heatmaps for population vs. death density.

## Learnings ðŸ§ 
- The importance of clean data in efficient analysis.
- Building insightful visualizations to support data storytelling.
- Strengthening my understanding of feature correlations in datasets.
